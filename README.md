# Artemis-Financial-Secure-app---Software-Security-
Artemis Financial is a secure software design project focused on building a financial services application  with strong emphasis on system architecture, encryption, and risk mitigation.
# Overview 
The project demonstrates  object-oriented design principles, UML modeling, and secure coding practices to protect sensitive client data.  Key features include implementation of cryptographic algorithms (RSA, modular arithmetic), input validation,  and adherence to industry security standards. Designed to showcase software design abilities in system analysis,  requirements documentation, and secure application development.

Artemis Financial is a secure software design project focused on building a financial services application that protects sensitive client data. The project emphasizes system architecture, encryption, and risk mitigation, showcasing how structured design and object‑oriented principles can be applied to meet real‑world business requirements efficiently. By modeling the system with UML class diagrams and applying design constraints, the application demonstrates how thoughtful planning leads to scalable, maintainable, and secure solutions.

The application incorporates strong security features, including RSA encryption for secure communication, input validation to prevent vulnerabilities, and integration with OWASP Dependency Check to identify risks in dependencies. These measures highlight a security‑first approach to development, ensuring that sensitive financial information is safeguarded. The project also demonstrates the use of design patterns such as the Singleton for centralized service management, along with encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create reusable and efficient code structures.

Beyond technical implementation, the project underscores key software design abilities that align with systems analyst, project manager, and product manager roles. Requirements analysis was translated into enforceable system rules, while UML diagrams and documentation provided clarity for stakeholders. The architecture supports scalability and efficiency, and the emphasis on risk assessment reflects a commitment to industry standards. Together, these elements show how secure software design can bridge technical rigor with business needs, making Artemis Financial a strong example of professional system analysis and design.
